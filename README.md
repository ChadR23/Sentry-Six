## Privacy & Updates

Sentry Six includes a privacy-first approach to updates and analytics:

- **Automatic Updates**: The app checks for updates to keep running smoothly with the latest features
- **Anonymous Version Stats**: A random ID helps us see which versions are most popular so we can fix bugs faster
- **No Personal Info**: We never collect or send any personal information to our servers
- **First-Time Notice**: You'll see a one-time notification about these features when you first launch the app

This helps us improve Sentry Six while keeping everything private and transparent.
