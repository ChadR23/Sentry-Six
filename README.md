# SentrySix 

SentrySix  is a modern, feature-rich viewer and exporter for your Tesla Sentry and Dashcam footage, built with Python and PyQt6. It provides a fluid, intuitive interface to navigate, review, and export your clips with powerful tools not found in other viewers.

This project was remastered and significantly enhanced through a collaboration between Scott and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, building upon the excellent foundation of the original SentrySix by ChadR23.

-   [ ] Support for exporting clips as GIFs or image sequences.
-   [ ] Drag-and-drop support for clip folders.
-   [ ] Add Model Y (Juniper) front bumper camera support if/when it's used for Sentry/Dashcam.
