## 📁 **Folder Structure Analysis**

Your clips are organized in two separate SavedClips folders:

### **Folder 1**: `2025-07-09_18-15-12`
- **Clips**: 1-12 (6:04:29 PM - 6:14:43 PM)
- **Duration**: ~10 minutes
- **Status**: ✅ Complete sequence

### **Folder 2**: `2025-07-09_18-48-36` 
- **Clips**: 13-23 (6:37:42 PM - 6:47:56 PM)
- **Duration**: ~10 minutes  
- **Status**: ✅ Complete sequence

## 🔍 **File Size Analysis**

### **Normal File Sizes Detected**
- **Front Camera**: ~76-79MB (✅ Normal)
- **Back Camera**: ~39-40MB (✅ Normal)
- **Side Cameras**: ~39-40MB each (✅ Normal)

### **Anomalies Found**
1. **Clip 12** (`18-14-43`): All cameras show **~50% smaller file sizes**
   - Front: 35.6MB (normally ~78MB)
   - Others: ~18MB (normally ~40MB)
   - **Likely Cause**: Clip was cut short when recording stopped

2. **Clip 22** (`18-47-56`): Similar pattern - **~60% smaller files**
   - **Likely Cause**: Recording ended mid-clip

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Most Likely Scenario**: Manual Save Events
Your timeline shows **SavedClips** which are manually triggered events. The gap pattern suggests:

1. **6:04-6:14 PM**: First incident/event occurred
   - Tesla automatically saved 10 minutes of footage
   - Recording stopped at 6:14:43 PM (note smaller file sizes)

2. **6:14-6:37 PM**: **23-minute gap**
   - Car was likely parked/turned off
   - No dashcam recording during this period
   - Possible scenarios:
     - Shopping/errands
     - Charging stop
     - Meeting/appointment

3. **6:37-6:47 PM**: Second incident/event occurred
   - Tesla resumed recording and saved another 10 minutes
   - Recording ended at 6:47:56 PM

### **Alternative Scenarios**
- **SD Card Issue**: Card became full or corrupted between events
- **Power Issue**: Car went into deep sleep mode
- **Manual Intervention**: Driver manually stopped/started recording

## 🛠️ **Diagnostic Questions**

To better understand what happened, consider:

1. **Do you remember what happened around 6:14 PM?**
   - Did you park the car?
   - Was there an incident that triggered the save?

2. **What occurred around 6:37 PM?**
   - Did you return to the car?
   - Was there another incident?

3. **Tesla Settings Check**:
   - Is dashcam set to "Auto" or "Manual"?
   - What's your Sentry Mode configuration?
   - How much storage space was available?

## 📋 **Recommendations**

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Check SD Card Health**
   - Verify available storage space
   - Run disk check for errors
   - Consider formatting if issues persist

2. **Review Tesla Settings**
   - Ensure dashcam is set to continuous recording
   - Check Sentry Mode configuration
   - Verify power settings

3. **Timeline Verification**
   - Check if RecentClips folder has footage from 6:14-6:37 PM
   - Look for any SentryClips from that timeframe

### **Long-term Solutions**
1. **Upgrade Storage**: Consider larger/faster SD card
2. **Monitor Patterns**: Track if gaps occur regularly
3. **Backup Strategy**: Regularly copy important footage

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

The 23-minute gap in your timeline appears to be **normal behavior** for SavedClips events rather than a technical malfunction. SavedClips are triggered by specific incidents and don't provide continuous recording.

**To get continuous timeline coverage**, you should check:
- **RecentClips folder** for continuous recording
- **SentryClips folder** for security events

The debug system is working correctly and successfully identified:
- ✅ Exact gap timing and duration
- ✅ File size anomalies indicating clip truncation
- ✅ Folder organization patterns
- ✅ All camera functionality

**Next Steps**: Check your RecentClips folder for the missing 23 minutes of footage, as Tesla typically maintains continuous recording there while SavedClips are event-specific.
